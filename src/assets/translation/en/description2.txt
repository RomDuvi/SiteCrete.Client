Situated on the hillside, without neighbours, it offers a view on a majestic mountain cirque that you can enjoy from each of the many terraces or when basked in the infinity pool. All around, olive trees (including 32 on the property) stretch as far as the eye can see. The villa of 150 square metres has 3 double bedrooms, each with its own bathroom. Two equipped kitchens allow a partial or full rental of the house. Whether you are 2, 4, 6 people or more, you will always find a suitable rental solution.
